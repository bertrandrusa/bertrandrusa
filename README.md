I am a student at Missouri State University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. I have a big passion for technology and a strong desire to make a meaningful impact. While anyone can learn to code, my goal is to become a problem solver who uses technology to address real-world challenges.

### **1. Summary of the MSU Interviewing Handout (Bullet Points)**

1. **Types of Interviews**:
   - Screening Interviews: Quick interviews (often less than 30 minutes) to narrow down candidates.

    - Stay calm and professional, even if faced with awkward silences or unexpected questions.

13. **Post-Interview Reflection**:

14. **Thank You Notes**:
    - Send personalized thank-you notes or emails within 24 hours of the interview.
