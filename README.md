I am a student at Missouri State University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. I have a deep passion for technology and a strong desire to make a meaningful impact. While anyone can learn to code, my goal is to become a problem solver who uses technology to address real-world challenges.
