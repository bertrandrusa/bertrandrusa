I am a student at Missouri State University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. I have a big passion for technology and a strong desire to make a meaningful impact. While anyone can learn to code, my goal is to become a problem solver who uses technology to address real-world challenges.

Here‚Äôs a **cheat sheet for Finite Automata** focused on key concepts, examples, and diagrams:

---

### **Finite Automata (FA)**

1. **Definition**:
   - A Finite Automaton (FA) is a machine with a **finite number of states** used to recognize patterns within input strings.
   - **Types**:
     - **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)**: Exactly one transition per input symbol.
     - **Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)**: Can have multiple transitions for a single input, including Œµ (empty) transitions„Äê41‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê44‚Ä†source„Äë.

---

### **Components of FA**:
- **States (Q)**: A finite set of states.
- **Alphabet (Œ£)**: A finite set of symbols.
- **Transition Function (Œ¥)**: Describes transitions between states based on input symbols.
- **Start State (q‚ÇÄ)**: The state where the machine begins.
- **Accept State (F)**: One or more accepting states that define when a string is accepted„Äê41‚Ä†source„Äë.

---

### **DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton)**:
- **Characteristics**:
  - For each state and input symbol, there is exactly **one transition**.
  - No Œµ-moves (empty transitions).
  - Accepts a string if it ends in an accept state.
- **Formal Definition**:
  - A DFA can be described as a 5-tuple: (Q, Œ£, Œ¥, q‚ÇÄ, F).
- **Example**:
  - DFA to recognize strings ending in `00`:
    - Q = {S1, S2, S3}
    - Œ£ = {0, 1}
    - Œ¥(S1, 0) = S2, Œ¥(S2, 0) = S3, Œ¥(S3, 0) = S3, Œ¥(S3, 1) = S2, etc.
    - Start State = S1, Accept State = S3„Äê41‚Ä†source„Äë.

---

### **NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton)**:
- **Characteristics**:
  - Can have **multiple transitions** for the same input from a state.
  - Can have **Œµ-moves**, where the machine transitions without consuming an input.
  - Accepts a string if **any** transition path leads to an accept state.
- **Formal Definition**:
  - NFA is also described by a 5-tuple: (Q, Œ£, Œ¥, q‚ÇÄ, F), but Œ¥ can return **multiple states** for a given input or Œµ-moves.
- **Example**:
  - NFA to recognize strings containing `01`:
    - Q = {S1, S2, S3}
    - Œ£ = {0, 1}
    - Œ¥(S1, 0) = {S2}, Œ¥(S2, 1) = {S3}, Œµ-moves possible„Äê41‚Ä†source„Äë.

---

### **DFA vs NFA**:
- **DFA**:
  - One transition per input.
  - No Œµ-moves.
  - Always in one specific state at a time.
- **NFA**:
  - Multiple transitions for one input are allowed.
  - Can have Œµ-moves.
  - Can be in multiple states at the same time.
- **Equivalence**: Every NFA can be converted to a DFA, but the DFA might have more states„Äê41‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê44‚Ä†source„Äë.

---

### **Key Conversions**:

#### **NFA to DFA Conversion (Subset Construction)**:
- **Process**:
  - Each DFA state represents a **set of NFA states**.
  - Compute the Œµ-closure of states (set of all states reachable via Œµ-transitions).
  - For each input symbol, determine the set of reachable NFA states.
- **Example**:
  - If NFA states S1 and S2 can be reached on input `a`, create a DFA state representing {S1, S2}„Äê40‚Ä†source„Äë.

---

### **Closure Properties of Finite Automata**:
- Regular languages (recognized by FA) are closed under:
  - **Union**: Combine two FA using a new start state with Œµ-transitions.
  - **Concatenation**: Connect the accept states of one FA to the start state of another.
  - **Kleene Star**: Add Œµ-transitions from accept states back to the start state„Äê44‚Ä†source„Äë.

---

### **Regular Languages**:
- A **regular language** is one that can be recognized by a DFA or NFA.
- **Regular Expressions (RE)** describe regular languages, and every RE can be converted into an NFA„Äê44‚Ä†source„Äë.

---

### **Important Theorems**:
- **Kleene's Theorem**: A language is regular if and only if it can be recognized by a finite automaton.
- **Pumping Lemma**: Used to prove that certain languages are not regular by showing that for large enough strings, a portion of the string can be "pumped" (repeated)„Äê44‚Ä†source„Äë.

---

### **Key Examples**:

#### **DFA Example**:
Recognize binary strings that end in `00`:
- **States**: S1 (start), S2 (after reading 0), S3 (after reading 00).
- **Transitions**:
  - Œ¥(S1, 0) ‚Üí S2, Œ¥(S2, 0) ‚Üí S3.
  - Accept State: S3.

#### **NFA Example**:
Recognize binary strings that contain `01`:
- **States**: S1 (start), S2 (after reading 0), S3 (after reading 01).
- **Transitions**:
  - Œ¥(S1, 0) ‚Üí S2, Œ¥(S2, 1) ‚Üí S3.
  - Accept State: S3„Äê41‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê44‚Ä†source„Äë.
