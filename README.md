I am a student at Missouri State University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. I have a big passion for technology and a strong desire to make a meaningful impact. While anyone can learn to code, my goal is to become a problem solver who uses technology to address real-world challenges.

Hereâ€™s a **cheat sheet** based on the requested slides from **Conversions Between RE and FSM** and **Proof of Regular/Non-Regular Languages**:
### **1. NFA â†’ DFA Conversion (Subset Construction)**
- **Subset Construction**:
  - Start with the Îµ-closure of the NFA's start state as the DFA's start state.
  - For each input symbol, find the set of reachable states (Îµ-closure) from the current set of states.
  - Repeat this process for all states and inputs until no new states are found.
  - Each DFA state represents a **set of NFA states**.
### **2. Thompsonâ€™s Algorithm (RE to NFA)**
- **Thompson Construction**:
  - **Single Character**: Create a simple two-state NFA with the character as the transition.
  - **Concatenation (R1R2)**: Connect the NFA of `R1` to `R2` by linking `R1`'s accept state to `R2`'s start state.
  - **Union (R1 âˆª R2)**: Create a new start state with Îµ-transitions to the start states of `R1` and `R2`. Merge their accept states.
  - **Kleene Star (R*)**: Add Îµ-transitions from the accept state back to the start state, with an option to skip the NFA altogether via an Îµ-transition.
### **3. Subset Construction (NFA â†’ DFA)**
- **Steps**:
  - Start from the Îµ-closure of the NFA start state.
  - For each input symbol, move to the set of states that can be reached (Îµ-closure).
  - This process continues until every possible state combination is explored.
  - The result is a DFA where each state represents a **subset of NFA states**
### **4. Using Closure Properties to Show Regular Languages**
- **Closure Properties**:
  - Regular languages are **closed** under:
    - **Union**: If `L1` and `L2` are regular, so is `L1 âˆª L2`.
    - **Concatenation**: If `L1` and `L2` are regular, so is `L1L2`.
    - **Kleene Star**: If `L` is regular, so is `L*`.
    - **Intersection and Complementation**: Regular languages are also closed under these operations.

### **5. Building Regular Expressions for Specific Languages**
- **Example: Language L = { w âˆˆ Î£* | w contains aa as a substring }**:
  - Regular expression: `(a âˆª b)* aa (a âˆª b)*`.
- **Example: Language L = { w âˆˆ Î£* | |w| = 4 }**:
  - Regular expression: `Î£Î£Î£Î£` (four repetitions of any symbol from Î£).
