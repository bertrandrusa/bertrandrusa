While anyone can learn to code, my goal is to become a problem solver who uses technology to address real-world challenges.

Here‚Äôs a summary of the **Interviewing Handout** using bullet points:

   - Research the company and review the job description.
   - Prepare questions to ask the interviewers, avoiding salary or benefits questions during the first interview.

3. **Practice Interviewing**:
   - Use the Career Center‚Äôs mock interviews for practice.
   - Record yourself to evaluate your body language, tone of voice, and responses.
   - Practice answering questions naturally without memorizing answers to sound more genuine.

   - Strong handshake, good eye contact, and an approachable demeanor are crucial.
   - Practice smiling if nervous and work on maintaining relaxed mannerisms.

9. **During the Interview**:
   - Arrive 10 minutes early, greet everyone with respect, and maintain eye contact.
   - Stay focused on prepared responses, but allow the conversation to flow naturally.

10. **Post-Interview Reflection**:
   - Reflect on what went well and where you can improve after the interview.
   - Use the experience to prepare for future interviews.

11. **Thank You Letters**:
   - Always send a thank you letter or email within 24 hours, expressing appreciation and reiterating interest in the position.
   - Highlight any key points or skills you didn‚Äôt get to discuss in the interview.

12. **Post-Interview Follow-Up**:
   - If you don‚Äôt hear back by the expected date, follow up politely via phone or email to inquire about the status.

13. **Mock Interviews**:
   - The Career Center offers realistic mock interviews that simulate actual interview questions and scenarios.
   - Bring your r√©sum√© and a job description to the mock interview for a more realistic experience.

14. **Eye Contact and Mannerisms**:
   - Work on making consistent eye contact and minimizing nervous habits like fidgeting.

15. **Phone and Virtual Interviews**:
